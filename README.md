Firmware code for the  Smart Filament Buffer as published on [Thingiverse][https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3709082].

This filament buffer comes with an integrated filament run-out detector, which is based on the Arduino Nano and a bunch of linear Hall-Effect sensors.
An integrated OLED display makes reading the current status and configuration a breeze. 

The schematics for this project are pretty straight forward:

All the electronic parts will fit on a standard 60 x 40 mm prototype board.
